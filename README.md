# Refactoring Homework unit 01-HTML-Git-CSS

I was called upon to refactor the existing code into more semantic HTML code.  The existing code did not contain accessibility standards.  Below is a list of improvements made to both index.html and style.css.

## Html semantics added
- added the Nav element to the header
- added the figure element for the large photo on the top of the screen
- made elements for main and aside for Semantics
- the "Search engine optimization" section of the main element was missing the link from the nave bar" 
    - added "id=#search-engine-optimization"
- changed the div elements to section elements for more clarification on semantics within main and aside

## CSS properties
-consolidated some of the repeated properties in the style that were the same in multiple classes
